# Manual Update

If you are unable to or don't want to use WordPress' built-in updater it's possible to update Fonts Plugin Pro manually.

The plugin file (_fonts-plugin-pro.zip_) is available inside your account - [https://fontsplugin.com/account/](https://fontsplugin.com/account/)

You will need to login first, if you don't have an account you can [register here](https://fontsplugin.com/account-registration/).

First, click 'View Details and Downloads'.
