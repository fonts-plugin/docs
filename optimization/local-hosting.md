# Local Hosting

The local hosting feature allows you to host the fonts from your own server instead of Google’s. As well as being GDPR-friendly, this can also have performance benefits.

Enabling local hosting is a simple 1-click process.

Navigate to **Appearance → Customize → Google Fonts → Local Hosting**.

Then simply toggle the switch to the on position.

Press ‘Publish’ and the plugin will do all the work in the background.
