# Font Loading

The Font Loading feature is located at `Google Fonts` → `Font Loading`.

It’s extremely simply to use, simply untick any font weights you don’t need. Then press `Publish`.

Each font weight you remove can save a considerable amount of `kbs`. Most websites don’t use `Extra Light` or `Ultra Bold`, so they are great candidates for removal.
