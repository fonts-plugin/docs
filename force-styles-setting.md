# Force Styles Setting

The ‘Force Styles’ setting is located at Google Fonts → Debugging.![](https://fontsplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-fonts-force-styles.png)

In some cases, FontsPlugin can’t overwrite the theme-defined fonts on the frontend of your website. Enabling this setting defines the fonts using a stronger method.

Technical note: This setting applies the CSS !important rule to all font settings.
