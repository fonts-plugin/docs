# Installation

The Fonts Plugin is made up of two parts, the basic version and the Pro upgrade.

#### Basic Installation

Installing Google Fonts for WordPress is simple. First login to your WordPress admin dashboard. Then navigate to â€˜Pluginsâ€™ â†’ â€˜Add Newâ€™.

In the search bar type â€˜Google Fonts for WordPressâ€™.

Click â€˜Install Nowâ€™ and then â€˜Activateâ€™.

#### Pro Installation

Download the Pro version from your [account](https://fontsplugin.com/account/) page to your computer.

Navigate to â€˜Pluginsâ€™ â†’ Newâ€™.

Click â€˜Upload Pluginâ€™. Choose the _google-fonts-pro.zip_ file you just downloaded. Then click â€˜Activate Pluginâ€™.

The Pro version requires the basic version to function, if it is not already installed you will be prompted to do so.
