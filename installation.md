# Installation

Download the Pro version from your [account](https://fontsplugin.com/account/) page to your computer.

Navigate to `Plugins` â†’ `New`.

Click `Upload Plugin`. Choose the `google-fonts-pro.zip` file you just downloaded. Then click `Activate Plugin`.

The Pro version requires the basic version to function, if it is not already installed you will be prompted to do so.
