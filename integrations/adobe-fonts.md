# Adobe Fonts

**Note:** To use Adobe Fonts you will need a Creative Cloud account. Unlike Google Fonts, this is not a free service.

To begin using Adobe Fonts, navigate to _Fonts Plugin → Adobe Fonts_.

First you will need to add your API key to connect Fonts Plugin to your Creative Cloud account.

_You can retrieve your Adobe Fonts API Key here:_ [_https://fonts.adobe.com/account/tokens_](https://fonts.adobe.com/account/tokens)\_\_

Once you have saved your API key your "kits" will be retrieved. By default they will all be enabled by default, simply click disable to remove any you don't need.

By default all kits will all be enabled, simply click 'Disable Kit' to remove any you don't need.

Your Adobe Fonts will now be available to use in the Customizer and Post Editor. There's nothing else to do.
